# RenTech: The Company that "Solved the Market" 

## Overview and Origin
Renaissance Technologies LLC was officially founded in 1982 by Jim Simons but a number of key players were involved in the company's growth such as James Ax, Sandor Straus, Elwyn Berklekamp, Henry Laufer, Robert Mercer and Peter Brown. Renaissance Technologies LLC, or RenTech, operates in the quantitative trading domain and its (mostly) employee-owned Medallion fund is regarded as the most successful hedge fund in history. RenTech's two equity funds, Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA) have also enjoyed above average success in their time. 

Jim Simons is a renowned mathmatecian and cryptologist who left academia in 1978 with one goal in mind: beating the market. To accomplish this endeavor he would first start the hedge fund Limroy and the trading firm Monemetrics, where he and the soon-to-be RenTech team worked to develop  quantitative models to make buy/sell decisions for currency trading. From the beginning, Simons interest in the markets had little to do with traditional financial philospohies or techqinues such as pouring over balance sheets or doing extensive market research. Simons wanted to use market data to predict the market's future moves. On top of that, the fund would also aim to automate all trades, hoping to completely cut humans out of the trading process. 

## Business Activities
The Medallion fund, RIEF and RIDA have the same goal as any other hedge fund, which is to make their investors money. The problem which all quant firms have to solve is how to use data effectively or how to build a model(s) that identifies patterns and how to act on that information effectively or program a computer to do so. With that said, a well built program will optimize trading volume and timing to avoid moving the market or drawing attention to the trigger they're acting on.

The Medallion fund's main strategy is to maintain a market neutral portfolio and primarily gains from short term future and options trading (holding contracts for 24-48 hours before selling). While the complete understanding of how the fund's model operates is confidential, it's known the company heavily utilizes C and C++ and machine learning. RenTech takes in, cleans, and stores massive amounts of market data and alternate data such as satelite video, news headlines, and weather to look for pricing patterns and correlations. As stated before the main customers of the Medallion fund are RenTech employees, themselves. One could say this is an unfair advantage as it helps to attract well established academics and professionals to the company (even if you don't get a share in the fund, the bonuses add up). 

Around 2004, the size of the Medallion fund was a growing concern at RenTech. Simons and other top executives were of the belief that if Medallion got any bigger, its trading would start to affect its own trading. So in order to continue expanding, RIEF and RIDA were formed. RIEF and RIDA are equity funds and they primarily use the long term predicitive signals that Medallion had no use for. It also accepted the clients Medallion would not and had investors flocking to it, with an inital investment of 14 billion dollars. RIEF and RIDA use more traditional finance strategies, such as buying low and selling high and it's triggers stem more from balance sheet data. RIEF and RIDA are primarily intended for pension funds and large institutions. 

## Landscape
RenTech operates in the quantitative trading domain, which is still a relatively new field. Over the last 5-10 years, with the success of quant hedge funds such as DE Shaw, AQR Capital, RenTech and Citadel, traditional hedge funds have begun to use machine learning and AI to make trading decisions such as JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanely, Ally Financial, etc, and new hedge funds have emerged only using AI technology.  

## Results
While the Medallion Fund has been crowned champion just for its sheer size, it also measures up against the best hedge funds by other metrics such as annual returns and its Sharpe ratio, which guages the performance of a portfolio after adjusting for its risk (a score of 1-2 is generally regarded as good). Since 1998, the fund has averaged almost 40% net returns compared to 32% returns from George Soros and the Quantum Fund, 30% from Steven Cohen and SAC and 20.5% from Warren Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway. As for Medallion's Sharpe ratio, by all third-party estimates (Medallion does not release its earnings to the public) they've had a ratio above 2 for the last decade. 

## Recommendations
Because Medallion is a private fund and because RenTech has deemed it at max capacity, to garner more business I would propose they open up their equity hedge funds to individuals. They could have a fund that essentially pools all individual investors contributions and distributes profits based on intiial investment. This would open the door to clients who do not work for large institutions or work for companies that don't offer retirement plans, such as consultants, contractors, and part-time workers.
