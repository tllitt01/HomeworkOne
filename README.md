# RenTech Title 

Renaissance Technology was officially founded in 1982 when the hedge fund Limroy was renamed. It is founded by Jim Simons but a number of key players were involved in the company's growth such as James Ax, Sandor Straus, Elwyn Berklekamp, Henry Laufer, and Peter Brown. Renaissance Technology, or RenTech, operates in the quantitative trading domain and it's private, employee-owned Medallion fund is regarded as the most successful hedge fund in history. RenTech's two equity funds, RIEF and RIDA, have also enjoyed success. RenTech's Medallion fund primarily gains from short term future and options trading that is done entirely without human intervention. In this way, RenTech heavily utilizes financial technology in two key ways: predicting bets using statistical modeling and writing programs that will execute a bet at the optimal time. Other companies in this domain are Two Sigma, D E Shaw, AQR Capital and others, but RenTech remains the largest capital-wise, with an estimated networth of 130 billion dollars . 

Jim Simons was a renowned mathmatecian and cryptologist who left academia in 1978 with the goal of beating the market, but he was not going to do this the traditional way. He fully intended to use his mathmateical background to develop statistical models that would predict successful trades--and he fully intended to follow through. Meaning: the goal was to completely remove people from the decision making process. Simons, and the rest of the finance world, and we should too, know that people are sometimes irrational and the idea was to find the pattern in the irrationailty and exploit it. But the idea of finding a pattern in irrationality sounds contradictory. Hence, the slow start of quant trading in industry and RenTech is no different. It would take almost a decade, and a few disastrous market crashes along the way, for quant firms to hone in their strategies, but when RenTech did their Medallion fund returns were unprecedented. The key was in short term trading, the strategy of holding contracts for less than 24-48 hours before selling. Originally, RenTech was like any other hedge fund with clients they had to keep happy, but after a few years of amazing success in the futures and options markets RenTech bought out their clients and became an employee owned fund. They would add their equity firms to the portfolio only after it was determined the Medallion fund had capped out. RenTech is unique in the fact that it does not employ traditionally trained finance professionals, most employees being PhDs of some sort, from physics to math to computer science and even meteorology.
